# Personal Online Resume
My personal Resume/CV made with HTML and CSS. \
The archive folder contains old versions of this resume so that they can still be viewed over github pages.
\
Will be extended to display more data via tooltips on hover.

PDF in standard DIN A4 Format can be created by printing the website using chrome or opera (other browsers not working or not tested). \
To print it the way it looks online: open the print dialog, check "background graphics", set margins to "None" and select "Save as PDF" as destionation.
\
Feel free to use this as a template for your own resume/cv if you like.
