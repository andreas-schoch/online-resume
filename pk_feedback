Very good CV and layout, just a few things:
 - you’re young, so your age on the CV could be beneficial to your case
 - remove ‘About’ header.
 - in that section, be more specific that ‘turn professional’. Maybe something like ‘becoming a full-time front-end developer’ (or similar)
 - Try to not use ‘hobby’, instead use ‘Personal project’ both in your summary and the Experience section. Actually on that section, don’t put an end date, it’s good for it to overlap across all your other experiences (they love people engaged with 3rd party projects)!
 - Propulsion section: give it a bit more structure on the skills front (e.g. front-end, back-end and devops). Also, put the name of StoryShare instead of ‘a company’.
 - Education: give an idea of when you finished high-school, so that the person reading doesn’t have to speculate.
 - Capitalisation on the ‘video courses completed’
